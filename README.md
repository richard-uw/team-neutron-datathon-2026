# Systemic Gaps in Access to Care

This project explores the systemic gaps in the United States healthcare system, 
focusing on how identity, income, age, and disability status can impact a 
person's ability to receive quality care in a timely fashion. Using the data 
from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and looking at the time frame 
2019 - 2023, we wanted to reveal the “why” behind these unmet and delayed 
healthcare needs.
